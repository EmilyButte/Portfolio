      <p>
        After more than 10 successful years in the feild of pathology, I wanted to learn an in-demand skill that would allow me to use my love of problem solving to expand the possiblities of my career. I've spent the last year exploring software development; learning enough to have a fluency in the profession's jargon and to consider myself a novice developer. Now I am looking for a new opportunity that would combine my passions: science, healthcare, technology, management and finding solutions to tough problems.
