        <h2>Undergraduate Education</h2>
        <p>Driven by curiosity and desire to understand the world around me, I studies biology as an undergraduate student at <a href="https://www.cord.edu/" target="_blank">Concordia College</a> in Moorhead, MN. After graduating with a bachelor degree in biology, I got my first job working as a lab assistant at <a href="https://www.pmspc.org/" target="_blank">Pathology Medical Services,</a> a pathology laboratory in Lincoln, NE. I worked hard to learn the business and was rewarded with extra responsibilities and the opportunity to acquire new skills, but my growth there was quickly capped by my education level.</p>

        <h2>Graduate Education</h2>
        <p>I chose to go to graduate school to continue studying pathology with the goal of working in cancer biology. After graduating from Drexel University with a master's degree in molecular pathobiology, an opportunity to work for a start-up presented itself and I jumped at the opportunity to get in at the ground level in an industry that really interested me. I then spent the next 7years at that company; a company that started consulting with doctors offices to design, build-out, staff and train employees for in-house pathology labs. The business grew steadily, expanding our consultation offering and getting into the sales of lab equipment and supplies. I had worked my way from the title of “ Laboratory Consultant” to “Director of Clinical Operations”, adding new lab techniques, business skills and experience to my resume.</p>

        <h2>Career</h2>
        <p>In the position, I occasionally came across customers who ultimately couldn’t build their own in-house lab for one reason or another. These customers were referred to one of many big nationwide laboratory service outsourcing resources. The owner of the company and I started brainstorming about how we could capture that revenue that we were freely shipping off to one of the national labs. We found that our customers were not happy with the service they were getting from these monster labs and we decided to start our own lab. With the help of a third partner, taking the lead role in sales, we started Freedom Pathology Partners.</p>

        <p>I spent the next 2 years focused on the success of that business. My title was “VP of Operations” and my role was to oversee the daily operations of the lab. This included everything from hiring and overseeing staff, making sure our procedures met expected regulations, customer satisfaction and quality control, to name a few.</p>

        <p>It was rewarding, but difficult work. I ultimately decided that the financial and social obligations of owning a business was not for me. I part of my share of the business to one of the other partners and am now a minority owner, who happily watches my “baby” grow under the watchful eye of others.</p>

        <h2>Coding</h2>
        <p>Having sold the business, I wanted to take some time to learn something I had long been wanting to learn, but didn’t have the time to; coding. Not many times in life do you have the financial and temporal freedom to pursue something like this, so I took advantage of it and spent the next 9 months completing 12 weeks of intense software development training along with an apprenticeship putting those skills to work.</p>

        <p>I am now searching for somewhere to settle in for the foreseeable future and use the experiences and skills I’ve acquired on a daily basis to help some else’s company succeed.</p>
