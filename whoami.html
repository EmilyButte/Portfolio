        <h3>
          A Deeper Dive...
        </h3>

        <h2>Undergraduate Education</h2>
        <p>Driven by curiosity and the desire to understand the world around me, I studies biology as an undergraduate student at <a href="https://www.cord.edu/" target="_blank">Concordia College</a> in Moorhead, MN. After graduating with a bachelor degree, I got my first job was as a lab assistant at <a href="https://www.pmspc.org/" target="_blank">Pathology Medical Services,</a> a pathology laboratory in Lincoln, NE. I worked hard to learn the business and was rewarded with extra responsibilities and the opportunity to acquire new skills, but my growth there was quickly capped by my education level.</p>

        <h2>Graduate Education</h2>
        <p>I chose to go to graduate school to continue studying pathology with the goal of working in cancer biology. After graduating from <a href="http://drexel.edu/medicine/about/departments/pathology-laboratory-medicine/" target="_blank">Drexel University</a> with a masters degree in molecular pathobiology, an opportunity to work for a start-up presented itself and I jumped at the opportunity to get in at the ground level in an industry that really interested me. I then spent the next 7 years working for <a href="http://www.pathlabsolutions.com/" target="_blank">Pathology Lab Solutions</a>; a company that consulted with doctor's offices to design, build-out, staff and train employees for in-house pathology labs. The business grew steadily, expanding our consultation offering and getting into the sales of lab equipment and supplies. I had worked my way from the title of “ Laboratory Consultant” to “Director of Clinical Operations”, adding new lab techniques, business skills and experience to my resume.</p>

        <h2>Career</h2>
        <p>In that position, I occasionally came across customers who ultimately couldn’t build their own in-house lab, for one reason or another. These customers pathology needs were outsourced to one of the national laboratory service. The owner of the company and myself started brainstorming about how we could capture the revenue we were just handing off to one of the national labs. Between the two of us, we had the business and technical skills to open a pathology laboratory, so we did. With the help of a third partner, taking the lead role in sales, we started <a href="http://www.freedompathology.com/" target="_blank">Freedom Pathology Partners.</a></p>

        <p>I spent the next 2 years focused on the success of that business. My title as “VP of Operations” had me overseeing the daily operations of the lab. This included hiring and supervising the staff, making sure our procedures met expected regulations, customer satisfaction, quality control and more.</p>

        <p>Once the pathology lab was off the ground, I decided to take advantage of having the time and means to aquire a skill that I had long been wanting to learn; <span style="font-weight:bold">computer coding.</span></p>

        <h2>Coding</h2>
        <p>Having handed off a majority of my responsiblities at the laboratory, I applied to and was accepted to <a href="http://www.zipcodewilmington.com/" target="_blank">Zip Code Wilmington,</a> a 3 month coding bootcamp that taught me the skills I needed to enter the world of software development. I then did a 6 month apprenticeship in the banking industry, where I learned how software really does power everything and how code is used to run an organization.</p>

        <p>I am now looking for an opportunity to use the experiences and skills I’ve acquired, to help another company or organization succeed.</p>
